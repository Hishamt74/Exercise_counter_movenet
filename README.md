# Exercise_counter_movenet
## Project Overview
This project leverages MoveNet, a real-time pose estimation model, to encode human exercise movements into structured data. It aims to analyze and track exercise performance using keypoint detection and motion analysis.
## Objectives
Detect human body keypoints using MoveNet.
Track and analyze exercise movements.
Encode exercise data for real-time feedback and performance evaluation.
Provide insights into form correctness and movement efficiency.
## Features
Real-time Pose Estimation: Detects human body keypoints in real-time.
Exercise Recognition: Identifies specific exercises using keypoint motion patterns.
Form Analysis: Evaluates posture correctness.
Performance Metrics: Tracks repetitions, angles, and motion consistency
##Technologies Used
Python for data processing and model implementation.
TensorFlow & TensorFlow Lite for MoveNet model integration.
OpenCV for video processing.
NumPy & Pandas for data analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization.
## Future Enhancements
Integration with wearable sensors for improved accuracy.
AI-driven feedback mechanism for personalized coaching.
Support for multiple exercise types.
